# Tesla Turbine Reconstruction Project
 This repo contains the SolidWorks and STL files that were made in order to model and 3D print the Tesla Turbine according to the specifications laid out in Nikola Tesla's original turbine patents.

# Original Patent Design
This folder contains the SLDPRT and STL files for each piece of the turbine according to the specifications of Nikola Tesla's first turbine patent.

# Modified Patent Design
This folder contains the STL for the turbine disks according to the specifications of Nikola Tesla's second turbine patent. Other original patent parts where reused for the modified design.

# Assemblies
This folder contains the SLDASM files for the turbine. The Disk Pack Assembly shows the assembled rotor. The Tesla Turbine Assembly shows the entire machine assembled, with the rotor installed inside the stator.

# Notes and Comments
 I did this project a long time ago now (2016 I think). Because of this, there are some things to note about this project:
 1. Some files may be missing. These are all the ones I can find and are certainly the majority of them.
 2. I am unsure if the current version of SolidWorks will open up the SLDPRT and SLDASM files or what the accuracy of the result would be.
 3. At the time, I did not think to export all the SolidWorks files to STLs nor did I think to document the process in much detail. Most of the parts were exported to 3D print them.
